## Data Augmentation 

Learn from ChatGPT

### Image Augmentation

* **Random Rotation** : Rotating the image by a random angle to introduce variations in object orientations.

* **Random Translation**: Shifting the image horizontally and vertically to simulate different object positions.

* **Random Scaling**:  Rescaling the image by a random factor to simulate different object sizes.

* **Horizontal/Vertical Flipping**: Flipping the image horizontally or vertically to create mirror images.

* **Gaussian Noise** : Adding random Gaussian noise to the image to make the model more robust to noise in real-world scenarios.

* **Color Jittering**: Randomly adjusting brightness, contrast, saturation, or hue of the image to improve robustness to different lighting conditions.


### Text Augmentation

* **Random Word Replacement**: Randomly replacing words in the text with synonyms or similar words to introduce variations.

* **Random Word Insertion/Deletion**: Randomly inserting or deleting words from the text to simulate noisy or incomplete data.

* **Random Character Substitution**: Randomly substituting characters in the text to simulate typing errors or misspellings.

### Audio Augmentation

* **Time Stretching**: Stretching or compressing the audio signal in time to change its duration.

* **Pitch Shifting**: Increasing or decreasing the pitch of the audio signal to simulate different speakers or musical tones.

* **Noise Injection**: Adding random background noise to the audio signal to improve robustness to noisy environments.
