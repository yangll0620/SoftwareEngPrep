## Modern C++

- C++ is standardized by an ISO working group known as JTC1/SC22/WG21. So far, it has published six versions of the C++ standard and is working on the next version: C++ 23

| Year  | ISO/IEC Standard | Informal Name | 
| ----- | :---------------:| :-----------: |
| 1998  | 14882:1998       |   C++ 98      |
| 2003  | 14882:2003       |   C++ 03      | 
| 2011  | 14882:2011       |   C++ 11      | 
| 2014  | 14882:2014       |   C++ 14      | 
| 2017  | 14882:2017       |   C++ 17      | 
| 2020  | 14882:2020       |   C++ 20      | 
| 2023  |                  |   C++ 23      | 

- The C++ language has two main components: a direct mapping of hardware features provided primarily by the C subsets, and zeor-overhead abstractions based on those mappings.

- The C++ standard consists of two parts: the core language and the standard libardy. C++ programmers expect the latter on every major implementation of C++: 
    - aggregate types (vectors, lists, maps, sets, queues, stacks, arrays, tuples)
    - algorithms(find, for_each, binary_search, random_shuffle, etc.)
    - input/output facilities (iostream, for reading from and writing to the console and files)
    - filesystem library
    - localisation support
    - smart pointers for automatic memory management
    - regular expression support
    - multi-threading library
    - atomics support (allowing a variable to be read or written to by at most one thread without any external synchronisation)
    - time utilities (measurement, getting current time etc.)

- Modern C++ refers to C++ 11 and later.
