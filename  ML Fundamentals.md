## ML Knowledeges

### Basic
* Overfitting vs Underfitting
* Bias/Variance trade off
* How to avoid overfitting
* Generative vs Discrimitive

### Reguarlization
* L1 vs L2 (difference, Lasso/Ridge)
* why choose on over the other
* Why regularization works

### Metric
* precision, recall and their trade-off
* imbalance, use which metric
* classification problem, which one to use
* confusion matrix
* AUC
* true positive rate, false positive rate, ROC
* logloss, wheßn to use

## Loss and Optimizer
* MSE
* Linear Regression 最小二乘法 and MSE
* relative entropy, cross entropy
* K-L divergence
* loss of logistric regression
* loss of SVM
* when and why use cross entropy
* Decision tree split node
