## Bias and Variance

* Bias is the difference between the predictions of the model and the actual values. High bias can cause an algorithm to miss the relevant relations between features and target outputs (underfitting)

* Variance is the variability of model prediction. High variance may result from an algorithm modelling the random noise in the training data (overfitting).
